###Hello world

I've been working with a lot of smart people doing useful research. There has been an increasing demand for me to discuss some of the lessons I've learned. Thus, the birth of this blog.

###Things I do

I have a bit of experience with big data generation and analysis using now generation sequencing technologies. I work with microbial communities in all sorts of environments including soils, wastewater, and the human gut.  Recently, I've developed interests in viruses that are around us.

###Things I'm not so good at...yet.
Please bear with me on the formatting of this blog.  I am very new to the under the hood machinery and will get it figured it out eventually.
