# Background

Hi!  My name is Adina Howe, and I thank you for considering my
qualifications to serve on the [Steering Committee of the Software
Carpentry Foundation](http://http://software-carpentry.org/).

Software Carpentry has played a major role in my professional
development, and I would argue played an integral role in my ability
to fulfill my dreams as becoming a tenure-track professor.  In 2008, I
participated in a Software Carpentry bootcamp at Michigan State
University as a postdoc.  At the time, my research required some
computational prowess, which frankly, I didn't possess.  SWC
provided me a foundation, resources, and mentors to help me improve my
skills and discuss my frustration and eventually success!  This impact
(and great instruction and mentorship) insprired me to join as one of
the first round of instructors (2011-ish).  For more details, please
feel free to peruse my see my [complete vitae](/pdfs/cv_howe_jan2015.pdf).

Currently, I am an assistant professor at Iowa State University in
[Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering](http://abe.iastate.edu)
where I am so excited to be leading the [Genomics and Environmental
Research in Microbial Systems (GERMS) Lab](http://germslab.org) where
we apply all the skills that SWC teaches for teaching and research.
I hope to be developing classes integrating many of the topics we
discuss for Iowa State as well.

# Previous Involvement with SWC

Like many of you, I have been involved in the development,
instruction, and evaluation of bootcamps/workshops in the past three
years.  I also am proud to say that I love to brag about SWC and the
opportunities it provides.  I have contributed to bringing SWC to the state of Iowa,
teaching both of the first bootcamps in the state.    In total, I have
taught a total of 8 bootcamps.  I have helped recruit and mentor at least four
to five new instructors (that I can think of).  The best way
to summarize my involvement is that I have been and continue to be personally
invested in SWC and advocate for the organization and its mission when
I can.

# What I'd like to do

Going beyond my past role in SWC, I think my experience, strengths,
and new position could help SWC in three strategic ways:

1)  Identify and serve a broader SWC audience 

The majority of my workshops have hosted graduate students.  A few of
professors, staff, and undergraduates have also been involved, and I
think there is an opportunity to reach out, serve, and impact this audience.
Importantly, I think these opportunities are fundable (e.g., the [NSF
Research Experiences for Undergraduates](http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5517&from=fund)). I believe that the skills we teach are useful beyond STEM
students and would like to explore these opportunities.

2)  Increase the effectiveness and impact of our lesson plans and examples

With the growing number of instructors, we have the energy and help to
improve our lesson materials.  I'd be interested in exploring specific
example datasets wrapped around SWC lessons that could be used for
targeted audience.  For example, for bioinformatics, we could parse
sequencing datasets rather than text files describing counting
animals.  Though teaching the same lessons, I think this would be
incredibly useful and attractive to students.

3)  Be thoughtful of the long term mission and visions of SWC and how
we can make it a reality

Funding for a program like this is always going to be a challenge, and
I would like to have plans for moving forward in sustainable
direction.  Further, I want to make sure that our mission and visions
are discussed, representative, and transparent.

Thank you for your consideration of me for the board.  I have loved
being involved with SWC and look forward to my future involvement in
any capacity that helps the foundation!
