<h1>Hello world!</h1>

<p>I’ve been working with a lot of smart people doing useful research. There has been an increasing demand for me to discuss some of the lessons I’ve learned. Thus, the birth of this blog.</p>

<h1>Things I dabble in</h1>

<p>I have a bit of experience with data generation and analysis using "now" generation sequencing technologies. I work with microbial communities in all sorts of environments including soils, wastewater, and the human gut.  Recently, I've developed interests in viruses that are around us.</p>

<p>Please bear with me on the formatting of this blog.  I am very new to the under the hood machinery and will get it figured it out eventually.</p>
