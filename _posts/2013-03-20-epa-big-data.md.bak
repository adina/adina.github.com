I'm just returning from the EPA Air Sensors Workshop in sunny and warm Raleigh, NC (grrr...Michigan winter).  I was invited out as a suggestion by my previous boss, a sequencing big-data guru.  Some folks at the EPA community had heard his talk at the National Academy of Sciences and invited him out, but they got me instead.  :)  

## My relationship defining talk with Big Data 

Initially, I was more than a little tenuous about my ability to deliver a big data talk.  Reflecting back, I was being silly. What defines a big data expert after all?  I've been in a role somewhere between data generator, tool developer, and data integrator/analyzer for large sequencing datasets for years now.  And NOT practicing what I preach, I wasn't valuing the advantages of having experiences and opinions in these very-different domains.  At this meeting, I was able to communicate (hopefully helpfully) what a big data deluge feels like to folks in these different roles and what the specific challenges and solutions might be.  

At the meeting, I gave a 15 minute presentation on big data in biology, but the real fun was talking to folks after my talk and at the subsequent breakout sessions.  It was a novel experience to be communicating about "lessons learned" to people outside my field who are actually anticipating and preparing for all the problems I found myself immersed in.  I thought a lot about where we as a field might be if we had talked to the physicists and Amazons/Googles (and each other) four years ago.  

## Meeting summary

I'll tried to summarize three points that were particularly thought provoking below from my conversations in either breakout groups or with individuals about how to start integrating data and efforts in the air sensor community.

Many of the folks I talked to wanted some sort of platform to start integrating different types of datasets.  At least two people mentioned a specific example of integrating Google traffic data, air quality data, and some sort of human health indicator (i.e., ashtma reactions).  Others pointed out that they wanted the "Google" equivalent to search sensor data -- but I think they actually wanted a platform with a search function.

###Standards always get a priority in the discussion.
Typical to biological equivalents of this conversation, this discussion moved towards the need for standards of metadata accompying datasets.  Standards and I have a love-hate relationship -- see this clever XKCD for explanation.  The need for a good quality and quantity of metadata is obvious in its usefulness to me.  I'm just not sure how to get this done in an environment where everyone has different goals in a data collecting community.  The flexibility of data access accompanies "loose" standardization.  I did note that the existence of some sort of standard helps me figure out what kind of data I should collect when sampling though -- a +1 for standards I often forget about.

Related sidenote on metagenomic standards:  MG-RAST (metagenomic annotation pipeline and data repository) has adopted the Genome Standards Consortia's template for metadata standards for metagenomic data. I just had a conversation with our team that I didn't think that most people didn't put in metadata because they didn't want to share it but rather because it was nearly impossible to put into our current format.  Its possible that we've been operating on a "nobody wants to share" assumption when the implementation of how to put in standards might be at fault. (We're going to start some logging and find out though -- I'll report on this in the future.)  

###Thinking about levels of function (not data)
On thinking of integrating different types of data, many folks agreed that they had to deal with different types of data and suggested that there should be different levels of organization of this data.  An interesting example and model of unqualified data integration is WeatherUnderground which collects weather-related measurements from anyone with a sensor who wants to contribute.  We talked about how one would want to integrate "citizen-collected" datasets differently.  Flipped around, you might want to provide different sorts of data output to the public than you might to researchers.  I tried to point out that the *growing* diversity of the types of questions, datasets, users, and tools is limited by structuring data access to "data types."  I gave examples of the KBase infrastructure where we try to build off a low-level data store and general data query services in layers of increasingly higher level functions.  In other words, I suggested that they imagine all the data in one place and think about what the end game for that data is and how they could get there.  And then for people with different end games, I asked if they thought they could share the same resources of someone else's effort.  I urged them to keep thinking bigger in what they wanted to do because I think this is how you have to deal with exponential growth.  It was fun to think about what this would look like for sensor data, and it gave me a better understanding of why I think the KBase model is a good one.  

Interestingly, a handful of attendees (and this is may be something political that I don't understand) were interested in "data widgets" rather than whole platforms.  I had a really hard time communicating that the widgets that they wanted could part of a platform solution.  I can only assume that a "widget" is something they could buy independently vs. a platform which would be a community-driven investment.  

###Not-as-big data at high velocity

Air sensor data can be meaured in seconds and needs to be analyzed and communicated in very short periods of time -- think summaries of daily air quality (airnow).  I started mulling about what this means for data management and integration.  The focus here is on arguably less heterogeneous datasets (compared to biological data) but the ability to process and integrate it rapidly.  A solution here would be to have a service that takes care of streaming and automating data delivery, analysis, and communication connected to platform that might just store the data so that it could be used for other functions. 

As a fun walk in daydreaming mode, I imagined getting streaming sequencing data for a transcriptome expressed in "real time" and being able to provide live assessent of the regulation processes (or even just the sequences) that were changing or not changing.  That would be pretty cool -- and I think its possible.  I imagine this happy chemostat with robots doing DNA extraction and library prep going right into a sequencer and a spiffy computer spitting out the answers.   Its a different perspective that we're all working with "sensors" and that the resolution of "great" sensing not only includes accuracy but "real time" speed (which computationally efficiency is definitely a part of the solution).

It was a great experience at the workshop.  People were friendly, enthusiastic, and did a great job making me feel useful (even to the point of blowing up my ego.)  I'm really glad I got invited and convinced to go. If you get a chance to have an out-of-domain-expertise experience, do it!

Love to hear your feedback!
