We're looking for someone to join our team!  If you're enthusiastic, curious, and believe in "work hard, play hard!" -- you'll enjoy working with Kirsten and me.  I've spent years training under Titus Brown and Jim Tiedje to become a metagenomics guru and *hopefully* a fabulous mentor.  I want to answer challenging questions with thoughtful experimentation and with multiple approaches.  This research will make a difference for our future.  Interested?  Apply!

#The official job listing

A postdoctoral position is available to investigate microbial communities in agricultural soils and their impacts on ecosystem function and stability. The postdoc position will be in the Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology (EEOB) at Iowa State University (ISU) and will be also be in collaboration with the Mathematics and Computer Science Division at Argonne National Laboratory.  This postdoc will be joining the teams of Kirsten Hofmockel (ISU) and Adina Howe (Argonne National Laboratory).  There are also opportunities to collaborate with the Genome Informatics Facility at ISU.  This research will involve leveraging next-generation sequencing (metagenomics and metatranscriptomics) of field soils and soil enrichments to test hypotheses about microbial responses to land management and climate change as well as integrating results into current carbon models.  Ideal candidates for this position will have experience in microbiology, microbial ecology, next generation sequencing, computational biology, statistics, and/or modeling.   A strong enthusiasm for developing open-source computational and analytical approaches for exploring microbial ecology is highly required.  The start date is flexible, with a preference for starting in Spring, 2014.  Interested candidates should email questions or an application including a cover letter (less than one page), a CV, and a research statement (less than one page) to *postdoc.soil.microbe@gmail.com*.
