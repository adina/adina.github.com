When I was writing job applications, I wished I had some references of how others did it.  So here are mine...

I'm sorry I lost the solicitation for this, but it was fairly similar to this year's [solicitation](http://adina.github.io/pdfs/2015_posting.pdf).

* [Cover Letter](http://adina.github.io/pdfs/cover_letter_final.pdf) - I would suggest getting this down to one page if you can.

* [Research Statement](http://adina.github.io/pdfs/research.pdf) - Again, get this down to two pages if you can.  I think I was rushed on this particularly application and couldn't find the time to fuss with it.

* [Teaching Statement](http://adina.github.io/pdfs/teaching.pdf)

* [CV](http://adina.github.io/pdfs/cv.pdf)

* [Job Talk](http://www.slideshare.net/adinachuanghowe/job-talk-iowa-state-university-ag-bio-engineering) - I was asked to give a 90 minute talk, but after my AM meetings, decided that neither the audience or I could sustain that long. I checked with my chair, and we happily agreed that it would just fine if I reduced this to 60 minutes, so I did not present 80 slides!  It pays to be flexible.

Best of luck to all those on the hunt to find a great fit!
