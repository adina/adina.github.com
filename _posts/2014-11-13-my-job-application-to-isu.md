When I was writing job applications, I wished I had some references of how others did it.  So here are mine...

I'm sorry I lost the solicitation for this, but it was fairly similar ot this years [solicitation](http://adina.github.io/pdfs/2015_posting.pdf)

* [Cover Letter](http://adina.github.io/pdfs/cover_letter_final.pdf) - I would suggest getting this down to one page if you can.

* [Research Statement](http://adina.github.io/pdfs/research.pdf)

* [Teaching Statement](http://adina.github.io/pdfs/teaching.pdf)

Best of luck to all those on the hunt to find a great fit!
