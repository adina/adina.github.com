This is my very first blog post and its pretty scary (the process not the posts)!

## About Me
I've been working with a lot of smart people doing useful research.  There has been an increasing demand for me to discuss some of the lessons I've learned from people I trust and respect.  Thus, the birth of this blog.
## My experiences
I have a bit of experience with work big data generation and analysis using next generation sequencing technologies. I work with exploring microbial communities in all sorts of environments including soils, wastewater, and the human gut.
